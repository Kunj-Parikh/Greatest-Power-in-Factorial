# Greatest-Power-in-Factorial
A program to find the greatest power of a prime base(e.g. 2) that can evenly be divided by a given factorial(e.g. 100).

Here is a link to a Math Stack Exchange Question which I based this project on and what I'm trying to automate:

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7092/what-is-the-highest-power-of-2-dividing-100

Additionally, to verify that this program works, go to [Wolfram Alpha](www.wolframalpha.com) and ask it to prime factorize the factorial, (e.g. 2831 in my example test cases.) Then, find the prime number base that you want to find, and check answers with the result the code gave.
